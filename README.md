# Stock Consecutive Move Probability Analyzer

A Python tool for analyzing the probability of consecutive up/down moves in stock prices based on historical data patterns. This analyzer helps traders and investors identify potential momentum opportunities by calculating the statistical likelihood of price movements continuing or reversing.

## üöÄ Features

### Single Stock Analysis
- **Deep Statistical Analysis**: Analyze any stock ticker with comprehensive consecutive streak statistics
- **Multiple Timeframes**: Support for 1-minute to 1-month intervals (1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d, 5d, 1wk, 1mo)
- **Flexible Historical Data**: Load anywhere from days to years of historical data
- **Current Streak Detection**: Automatically identifies current consecutive up/down periods
- **Probability Calculations**: 
  - Next period probability (upside vs downside)
  - Period-after-next conditional probabilities
  - Historical streak distribution analysis

### S&P 500 Scanner
- **Mass Market Screening**: Scan all S&P 500 stocks simultaneously
- **Customizable Filters**: Set minimum probability thresholds for upside/downside moves
- **Smart Results Sorting**: Automatically sorts results by market capitalization
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with tqdm progress bars
- **Comprehensive Results**: View probability distributions, top opportunities, and detailed statistics

### Advanced Analytics
- **Streak Rarity Analysis**: Understand how rare current consecutive moves are historically
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify momentum patterns and reversal probabilities
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the statistical likelihood of trend continuation vs reversal
- **Market Cap Intelligence**: Prioritize larger, more liquid stocks in scanner results

```
Choose what you'd like to do:
2. Scan S&P 500 stocks for opportunities

Scanner Options:

2. Scan for downside probability  
3. Scan for both

Select scan type: 1
Enter minimum probability threshold: 75
```

**Example Scanner Output:**
```
SCAN RESULTS
================================================================================
Ticker   Price      Upside%  Downside%   Streak       Direction  Market Cap

MSFT     $415.26    82.1%    17.9%       2 periods    UP         $3.1T          
NVDA     $118.57    76.4%    23.6%       5 periods    UP         $2.9T          

TOP 10 UPSIDE OPPORTUNITIES:
 1. MSFT - 82.1% upside probability
 2. AAPL - 78.3% upside probability
 3. NVDA - 76.4% upside probability
```

## üìä Understanding the Analysis

### Consecutive Streaks
The analyzer identifies consecutive periods where:
- **Up Period**: Closing price > Previous closing price
- **Down Period**: Closing price ‚â§ Previous closing price

### Probability Calculations
- **Streak Extension**: Historical frequency of streaks continuing beyond current length
- **Streak Breaking**: Probability of current streak ending
- **Conditional Probabilities**: Future scenarios based on next period's direction

### Key Metrics
- **Current Streak**: Number of consecutive up/down periods
- **Historical Distribution**: Frequency analysis of all past streaks
- **Rarity Assessment**: How unusual the current streak length is
- **Market Cap Weighting**: Prioritizes larger, more liquid stocks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Data Limitations
- **Intraday Data**: yfinance limits high-frequency data (1m data limited to 7 days)
- **Weekend Gaps**: Analysis uses actual trading periods, not calendar days
- **Historical Bias**: Past performance does not guarantee future results

### Statistical Assumptions
- Assumes independence of consecutive moves (which may not hold in reality)
- Does not account for fundamental analysis, news events, or market conditions
- Probabilities are based purely on historical price patterns

### Risk Disclaimer
This tool is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions. Always:
- Conduct thorough fundamental analysis
- Consider current market conditions and news
- Implement proper risk management
- Consult with financial advisors when appropriate
